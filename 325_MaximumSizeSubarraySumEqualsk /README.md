Given an array `nums` and a target value `k`, find the maximum length of a subarray that sums to k. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

Note:
The sum of the entire nums array is guaranteed to fit within the 32-bit signed integer range.
Example 1:
Given nums = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3], k = 3,
return 4. (because the subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] sums to 3 and is the longest)
