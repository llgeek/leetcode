You have a boutique that specializes in words that don't have adjacent matching characters. Bobby has decided to get out of the word business altogether and you have bought his inventory. Your idea is to modify his inventory of words so that they are suitable adjacent pairs of matching characers and replace on of the characters with a different one. Determine the minimum number of charactrs that must be replaced to make a salable word. 

For example, you puchase words is:
`[add, book, break]`
You will create an array with your results from the tests. Change `d` in ad`d`, change `o` in bo`o`k and no changes is necessary for break. The return array is [1,1,0].
